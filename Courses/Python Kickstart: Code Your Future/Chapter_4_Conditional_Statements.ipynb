    "3. Add an `else` statement to print \"Minor\" if `age` is 18 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Multiple Conditions\n",
    "1. Create a variable `score` and assign it a value.\n",
    "2. Write an `if-elif-else` statement to print \"Excellent\" if `score` is greater than 90, \"Good\" if `score` is between 70 and 90, and \"Needs Improvement\" if `score` is less than 70.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Nested Conditional Statements\n",
    "1. Create variables `x` and `y` and assign them values.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4: Logical Operators\n",
    "1. Create variables `a` and `b` and assign them values.\n",
    "2. Write an `if` statement using the `and` operator to check if both `a` and `b` are positive numbers. If true, print \"Both are positive\".\n",
    "3. Write an `if` statement using the `or` operator to check if either `a` or `b` is a positive number. If true, print \"At least one is positive\".\n",
    "4. Write an `if` statement using the `not` operator to check if `a` is not a positive number. If true, print \"a is not positive\".\n"
